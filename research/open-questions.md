# Open questions

Things the specification decided provisionally, or has not decided. Each is a question
for a human. An agent may gather evidence; it does not settle these alone.

## Provisional numbers

1. **The §44 ceilings.** Five seconds for a kill switch, one hour of role staleness,
   seventy-two hours of approval validity, and the rest are the editor's proposals
   (AGENTS.md → decision 10). They need measurement in a real deployment. Which are
   too tight for a small tenant on a cheap host? Which are too loose for a bank?

## Design choices that deserve a second opinion

2. **Owner-approval mode at L3** (§16.2). The first instinct was to forbid it at L3.
   That would stop a sole proprietor from ever letting an agent pay a bill, so it is
   allowed with a ceiling, a cooling-off period, step-up authentication, a
   DSoR-rendered payload, and a second-channel notification. Is that set of
   compensating controls enough for an auditor?
3. **CEL over Rego** (§17.3). Chosen because a control condition is an expression
   inside a record, and CEL terminates. `@marcbachmann/cel-js` 8.0.0 ran the spec's
   vectors with flat `dsor_*` functions on 2026-09-19. Not yet checked: its behavior
   with `now`, with large lists, and its error types for DSOR-CTL-07.
4. **A recorded DENY is replayed for the same idempotency key** (§22). After a human
   fixes the permission, the caller needs a new key. Is that the behavior users
   expect, or should denials not claim a key?
5. **An invalidated proposal ends.** When re-evaluation finds a new `REQUIRE_*`
   outcome, the proposal becomes `INVALIDATED` and the caller proposes again (§26.4).
   The alternative, returning to `PENDING_APPROVAL` for the extra approval, is kinder
   to users and harder to reason about.
6. **Compound actions under one MUST.** A few requirements join closely related
   actions ("detect, mark stale, and notify"). Should they be split further?

## Not yet specified

7. **How DSoR learns that KSoR published a new policy version** (DSOR-CTL-03a says
   "detect"; it does not say subscription or polling, or what KSoR must expose).
8. **The conformance suite's shape.** One test per id is the goal. Is it a vitest
   package that targets any DSoR over HTTP and MCP, or a harness each implementation
   embeds?
9. **The rate source contract.** §9 names a tenant rate source. What interface does it
   have, and how is a stale or missing rate reported?
10. **Tokenized fields as command inputs** (DSOR-CLS-02c). The rule exists; the token
    format and lifetime do not.
11. **MCP catalog size.** §38.1 recommends domain-scoped endpoints. Nothing has
    measured tool-selection quality against catalog size for this vertical.
12. **The reference control-plane store shares a PostgreSQL cluster with the
    operational store** so that DSOR-EXE-04a can commit atomically. What is the story
    when the system of record is SAP?

## The context providers (added 2026-09-20, decision 12)

13. **Does Graphiti hold up on real payment-run episodes?** Nothing has been run. Before
    the binding is frozen, feed it a few weeks of masked run logs and check: does the
    closed fact-type list keep operational state out (DSOR-CTX-07), or does state leak
    in through free-text summaries and community descriptions?
14. **What is the closed list of fact types?** A first proposal: Lesson, Preference,
    CounterpartyBehaviour, TaskOutcome, FailureCause. Who owns the list, and does
    changing it need review the way a control does?
15. **Which extraction model satisfies DSOR-CTX-08 for a tenant whose egress policy
    denies external providers?** A local model changes extraction quality. How much?
16. **A graph database on a student laptop.** FalkorDB or Neo4j beside PostgreSQL is a
    real cost for the target audience. Is there a light mode for the class project,
    and is memory even part of the class project? (No build stage needs it.)
17. **Erasure in a graph.** DSOR-RES-05 assumes values can be made unreadable by
    destroying a key. Extracted facts, summaries, and embeddings derived from an
    episode are not encrypted per subject. What does erasure of one person mean there?
18. **Two tenant-isolation models.** Graphiti partitions by group id, a filter. OpenViking
    has tenant, user, and agent scopes of its own. The cross-tenant test suite for the
    stack has to cover both, through the adapter.

## Found by the baby steps (added 2026-09-26)

19. **What does a query's answer look like?** Appendix A says `result-envelope` carries
    "command and query results", so DSOR-SCH-01 covers a query's answer. But a result
    envelope must name an outcome, and none fits a read. `COMMITTED`, `READY`, and
    `PENDING_APPROVAL` need a proposal and a payload hash. `VALIDATED` passes with only a
    `decision`, but it answers a `validate_only` dry run. DSOR-FRS-01a also asks every
    query result to state `observed_at`, the resource version, the connector, and the
    freshness delivered, and the closed schema has no field for any of them. Step 04's
    learner build answers a query with `{ data, correlation }` and records that this
    breaks DSOR-SCH-01. Does the result envelope need an outcome for a read, or does a
    query's answer need a schema of its own?
20. **Is a code's retry class the one in the §28 table?** DSOR-ERR-01a asks for "a code
    from this table ... a retry class". The error-envelope schema ties a class to a code
    for only three codes: `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`, `RESOURCE_HELD`, and `BATCH_PARTIAL`. So
    `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` with `safe_same_key`, "denied, try again at once", passes the
    schema. Should the rule say "the retry class the table gives that code", and should
    the schema tie all 32 codes? Two rows also carry a condition the schema cannot see:
    `DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT` is `safe_same_key` only for queries and for commands that
    provably did not run, and `INTERNAL_ERROR` is `never` "for commands".
